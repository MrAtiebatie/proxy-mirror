proxy-mirror
============

proxy-mirror is a very simple http sniffer running on node.

While [Charles](http://www.charlesproxy.com/), [HTTP Scoop](http://www.tuffcode.com/) work well and they are worth the price I think it's still useful to have **a free** alternative that hopefully will be easier to use than [mitmproxy](http://mitmproxy.org/).

For Windows there is an invaluable [Fiddler](http://fiddler2.com/) and while its possible to use it from Mac or Linux it seems to me that running a virtual machine just for it is an overkill.

Features
-----

proxy-mirror handles http and https using self signed certificate and displayes request response list with a simple detailed view.
*If only a day would be longer...*

Installation &amp; Usage
-----
I'll prepare an npm module soon for now the only way to use proxy-mirror is to clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/miensol/proxy-mirror.git
cd proxy-mirror
npm install
bower install
```

You will need to generate certificates and move them into a `cert` folder:

```bash
./setup-certificate.sh
mkdir cert
mv proxy-mirror.* cert/
```

You'll then need to start the proxy
```bash
node index.js
```

and configure your system to use proxy which is listening at `localhost:8888` there are script utils for that
- windows - `./setup-proxy.ps1 -Enable/-Disable`
- mac - `./setup-proxy.sh -enable/-disable`

To see and sniff around http traffic navigate to `http://proxy-mirror:8889` and you should be able to see the following:
